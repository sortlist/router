## 0.0.87 (2026-08-04)

### Features

#### Add `limits.max_request_header_size`

Adds a new `limits.max_request_header_size` configuration option (default: `64KiB`) that rejects requests whose HTTP headers exceed the configured size with `431 Request Header Fields Too Large`, before the request is processed.

Since the router propagates client headers (cookies, JWTs) to subgraphs, requests with oversized headers would previously be forwarded and rejected by the subgraph server's own header limit (e.g. Tomcat's 8KB default), surfacing as a confusing subgraph error. With this limit, such requests are rejected at the router with a clear error.

### Fixes

#### Expose request correlation IDs to plugins and middlewares

Request/trace correlation IDs are now extracted and scoped by a dedicated middleware that wraps the entire request pipeline, instead of only inside the GraphQL handler. 

This means plugins, the coprocessor runtime, and any other middleware can now log with the same `request_id`/`trace_id` as the rest of the request.

Fixes https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1351

#### Seed the embedded Hive Laboratory from the router config

Adds optional keys under `laboratory`: `operations`, named operations that each open in a pre-filled tab, and `collections`, named groups of operations shown in the Laboratory's sidebar. Each operation may carry `variables`, `headers` and `extensions` as native YAML maps.

Seeded values are embedded in the served page and visible via "view source", so they must not contain secrets. Seeded operations and collections are refreshed from config on every reload; work a user creates themselves is preserved.

#### Upgrade to latest laboratory

Upgrades the embedded [@graphql-hive/laboratory](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/releases/tag/%40graphql-hive%2Flaboratory%400.2.3) from 0.2.0 to 0.2.3.

**Added**

-   Copy as cURL in the operation toolbar.
-   A reload-schema button in the builder, which introspects over the network even when a schema was
    supplied by the host, and spins while the request is in flight. It replaces the previous
    "restore default endpoint" button; `restoreDefaultEndpoint` remains available on the API.
-   `introspection.pollSchema` setting to turn off the 5 second introspection poll and refresh the
    schema only on demand.
-   `enableFullScreen` prop (default `true`) so hosts that already fill the viewport can hide the
    full screen control.
-   The Query Plan tab is now always shown, with an empty state explaining that plans appear when
    the gateway returns `extensions.queryPlan`.

**Fixed**

-   The builder no longer collapses expanded fields while introspection is polling. An unchanged
    schema previously produced a new `GraphQLSchema` on every poll, resetting expansion to the depth
    of the current document.
-   Editor hovers now appear on mouse over, so validation messages and schema documentation are
    readable.
-   Monaco's folding chevrons render as icons instead of empty squares. Font faces are now
    registered on the document, where browsers resolve them, rather than inside the shadow root
    where they are ignored.
-   Response size is shown in real units instead of always reading `0KB`, and is measured in UTF-8
    bytes.
-   Tooltips attached with `asChild` now appear. `Button`, `TooltipTrigger` and `AlertDialogTrigger`
    did not forward refs, leaving the tooltip without an element to anchor to.
-   The builder's tree/list toggle is controlled, cannot be deselected into an empty state, and is
    disabled with an explanation until a search is active.
-   The Query Plan panel no longer throws while rendering when a response body is not JSON.
-   monaco-graphql is initialized once and updated in place, so variables validation registers
    regardless of which editor mounts first and survives an endpoint change.
-   Removed invalid nested buttons in builder and collection rows, which also makes the collection
    edit and delete actions keyboard reachable.
-   The query plan visualization no longer updates state during render.
-   The builder no longer resets its view when toggling settings, by hardening the merge code.

## 0.0.86 (2026-07-28)

### Fixes

#### Regular queries no longer count toward `max_long_lived_clients`

The long-lived client limit (`traffic_shaping.router.max_long_lived_clients`) classified requests from the `Accept` header alone, so clients that advertise streaming support on every operation (e.g. urql sends `..., text/event-stream, multipart/mixed`) had all of their queries and mutations counted against — and, past the limit, rejected by — the limit.

Long-lived clients are now counted where they actually become known:

- **WebSocket connections** are still reserved at upgrade time.
- **HTTP subscriptions** reserve a slot once the parsed operation is known to be a subscription — still before any planning/execution work — and release it when the client stream ends.

Regular queries and mutations never count toward the limit, regardless of their `Accept` header, matching the documented behavior. Over-limit rejections keep the same response (`503`, `Retry-After: 5`, `Too many long-lived clients`) and now happen inside the request span, so they are visible to tracing.

#### Replaced logging request-id generator

Version `0.0.85` introduced new logging runtime that uses `Sonyflake` crate to generate request-id in requests that doesn't have it passed via HTTP headers. 

The `Sonyflake` runtime can fail on some OS configurations. 

This change replaces the `Sonyflake` runtime with `uuid` generator, that's more fail-safe.

## 0.0.85 (2026-07-26)

### Features

#### Health and readiness now pass through the plugin `on_http_request` chain and its `on_end` callbacks

This is required because readiness in plugin-only mode must allow the plugin to select a supergraph for that specific readiness request.

Coprocessors still do not run for health or readiness.

### Fixes

#### Drop `with_schema` from the `on_graphql_validation` plugin hook

Remove `OnGraphQLValidationStartHookPayload::with_schema`. Replacing only the validation schema was unsafe because parsing, introspection, normalization, planning, demand control, execution, coprocessors, and schema-aware caches continued using the request's original supergraph.

Plugins that need a request-specific schema should construct and retain an `Arc<Supergraph>`, then select it in `on_http_request`:

```rust
fn on_http_request<'req>(
    &'req self,
    payload: OnHttpRequestHookPayload<'req>,
) -> OnHttpRequestHookResult<'req> {
    payload.set_supergraph(self.supergraph_for_request(&payload));
    payload.proceed()
}
```

Build each variant with `Supergraph::from_sdl` or `Supergraph::from_document` outside the request hot path and reuse the same `Arc<Supergraph>`. The router snapshots the selected supergraph and applies it to the complete request pipeline.

See `plugin_examples/replace_schema` for overriding a configured default and `plugin_examples/feature_flags` for plugin-only supergraph selection.

#### Logger improvements and access logs

Reworked the router's logging for lower overhead and clearer output.

- **Access logs:** at the default `info` level the router now emits a single per-request summary (`router::request` target) with operation, subgraph, error, status, payload size, and duration fields.
- **Correlation:** every log line carries `request_id` (from the `log.correlation.id_header`, default `x-request-id`, or generated when absent) and `trace_id` (from the W3C `traceparent` context when `log.correlation.trace_propagation` is enabled).
- **Explicit targets:** all logs use `router::*` targets, so `log.filter` (or `LOG_FILTER`) can raise or mute individual subsystems. To disable access logs entirely, set `LOG_FILTER=router::request=off`.
- **Internal crates:** logs from dependencies like `ntex` and `hyper` are now suppressed unless `log.log_internals` (or `LOG_INTERNALS`) is enabled.
- **Structured output:** flat JSON/text with no nested fields, formatted directly into buffers.

**Breaking changes:**

- The `trace` log level is no longer available in release builds.
- The `pretty-tree` and `pretty-compact` log formats were removed; only `text` and `json` remain.

#### Rename `on_supergraph_load` end hook payload `new_supergraph_data` field to `new_supergraph`

Bringing consistency across the new supergraph snapshotting practice.

```diff
fn on_supergraph_reload<'a>(
    &'a self,
    payload: OnSupergraphLoadStartHookPayload,
) -> OnSupergraphLoadStartHookResult<'a> {
    payload.on_end(|payload| {
-       let supergraph = payload.new_supergraph_data;
+       let supergraph = payload.new_supergraph;
        println!("{}", supergraph.public_schema.sdl);
        payload.proceed()
    })
}
```

#### Select a supergraph in the `on_http_request` plugin hook

Add `OnHttpRequestHookPayload::set_supergraph`, allowing a plugin to select a stable `Arc<Supergraph>` for an HTTP request or WebSocket upgrade. The selected supergraph is used consistently for validation, introspection, normalization, planning, demand control, execution, coprocessors, usage reporting, and request deduplication.

`Supergraph` contains schema-derived state only and can be built with `Supergraph::from_sdl` or `Supergraph::from_document`. Router-specific state, including subgraph executors and schema-aware caches, remains owned by the router. The router builds configured runtimes eagerly and plugin-selected runtimes lazily, reusing them through a bounded FIFO cache.

Plugins own the lifetime of their supergraphs. Dropping the last `Arc<Supergraph>` retires that supergraph: ordinary in-flight requests finish from their snapshots, active subscriptions close with the schema-reload error, and the router removes any cached plugin runtime in the background. Runtime eviction (when the internal bounded FIFO cache of supergraph runtimes evicts) does not retire a supergraph - if reused later, the router will rebuild the internal supergraph runtime.

See `plugin_examples/replace_schema` for overriding a configured default and `plugin_examples/feature_flags` for plugin-only supergraph selection.

#### Support custom GraphQL root type names

Hive Router now reads `query`, `mutation`, and `subscription` root type names from the schema instead of assuming they are named `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription`.

#### Subgraph Error Masking

Mask subgraph errors before they reach clients, preventing internal details from leaking.

Masking is **enabled by default**: subgraph error messages are replaced with `"Unexpected error"`. It runs last in the pipeline, so metrics, tracing, and logging still see the original error.

Configure it under `error_masking`:

```yaml
error_masking:
  enabled: true # enabled by default 
  redacted_error_message: "Unexpected error"
  all: # default config, unless you override it with subgraph-specific 
    enabled: true
    extensions:
      mode: allow # allow | deny
      keys:
        - code
  subgraphs:
    products:
      enabled: false
```

- `error_message` toggles message redaction; `extensions` redacts extension keys via an `allow`/`deny` list.
- `subgraphs.<name>` overrides `all` per subgraph, inheriting any field it doesn't set.
- Set `DISABLE_SUBGRAPH_ERROR_MASKING=true` to disable message masking without editing the config.

[Documentation](http://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/security/error-masking)

Fixes https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1194

#### Add `supergraph.source: plugin` for deployments where plugins are the only source of supergraphs

This source creates no loader and has no configured fallback. Readiness, GraphQL requests, and WebSocket upgrades return service unavailable until the request's plugin selects a usable supergraph.

HTTP readiness checks invoke plugin's `on_http_request`, in order for the readiness check to pass - a supergraph must be selected even during that readiness request.

See `plugin_examples/feature_flags` for `supergraph.source: plugin` with all variants selected by the plugin.

#### Upgrade to latest laboratory

[@graphql-hive/laboratory@0.2.0](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/releases/tag/%40graphql-hive%2Flaboratory%400.2.0)

Remove the request retry setting from the laboratory.

Retries are the wrong primitive for an interactive GraphQL IDE (the
user re-runs operations, and schema introspection already polls), and the underlying HTTP executor
retried on any GraphQL errors response while dropping request headers on the retry, so retries
went out unauthenticated. Existing persisted retry values are ignored automatically.

## 0.0.84 (2026-07-20)

### Fixes

#### Add an `on_graphql_analysis` plugin hook with safe operation filtering

Plugin authors can now inspect and filter operation fields after normalization and immediately before query planning. Fields can be kept or nulled with a GraphQL error while the router consistently updates the operation and response projection plan, making the hook suitable for authorization, rate limiting, progressive overrides, and similar policies.

#### Improve GraphQL operation validation

- **Faster validation (2-3x):** rules now share a single `OperationVisitor` pass over the operation document instead of each rule visiting it independently.
- **New `UniqueInputFieldNames` rule:** input object fields are now kept as a list rather than a map, so duplicate fields are no longer silently deduplicated before validation. A query like `{ field(input: { value: 1, value: 2 }) }` is now correctly rejected.
- **Fixed `VariablesInAllowedPosition`:** now accounts for default values on variables, field arguments, and input object fields. Nullable variables used in a non-null argument that defines a default are no longer incorrectly rejected.

### Fixes

- Bump version - no changes

## 0.0.82 (2026-07-13)

### Features

#### Add OpenTelemetry metrics for GraphQL subscriptions

Add end-to-end observability into subscription activity between clients, the router, and subgraphs.

### Live state

| Metric                                            | Labels                                    | Unit             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.active`        | `subscription.transport`                  | `{subscription}` | Active subscription operations from clients to the router   |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.connections`   | `subscription.transport`                  | `{connection}`   | Active client transport connections carrying subscriptions  |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.subgraphs.active`      | `subgraph.name`                           | `{subscription}` | Active subscription operations from the router to subgraphs |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.subgraphs.connections` | `subgraph.name`, `subscription.transport` | `{connection}`   | Active transport connections from the router to subgraphs   |

Operations and connections are measured separately because one connection can carry multiple operations, while subscription deduplication can fan one subgraph operation out to multiple clients.

### Lifecycle

| Metric                                              | Labels                                              | Unit             | Description                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.started_total`   | `subscription.transport`                            | `{subscription}` | Client subscriptions started   |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.ended_total`     | `subscription.transport`, `subscription.end_reason` | `{subscription}` | Client subscriptions ended     |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.subgraphs.started_total` | `subgraph.name`                                     | `{subscription}` | Subgraph subscriptions started |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.subgraphs.ended_total`   | `subgraph.name`                                     | `{subscription}` | Subgraph subscriptions ended   |

Every recorded start has exactly one matching end. Client end reasons are `completed` when the source finishes normally, `error` when an error is delivered to the client, and `client_disconnected` when the client disconnects, unsubscribes, or the router otherwise drops the stream.

The counters expose subscription churn and remain meaningful across router restarts. Comparing start and end rates can reveal mass disconnects or reconnect loops even when the active subscription count appears stable.

### Message delivery

| Metric                                                       | Labels                   | Unit        | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.sent_messages_total`      | `subscription.transport` | `{message}` | Messages successfully sent to client subscribers                           |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.clients.lagged_messages_total`    | `subscription.transport` | `{message}` | Messages skipped for lagging clients on broadcast fan-out                  |
| `hive.router.subscriptions.subgraphs.dropped_messages_total` | `subscription.transport` | `{message}` | Subgraph messages dropped because an internal subscription buffer was full |

Lagged and dropped counters increase by the number of messages skipped without terminating the subscription. `sent_messages_total / (sent_messages_total + lagged_messages_total)` provides the client delivery ratio for each transport.

`subscription.transport` can be `websocket`, `http_multipart`, `http_sse`, or `http_callback`. Units such as `{subscription}`, `{connection}`, and `{message}` are UCUM annotations that identify what each instrument counts.

### Fixes

#### Drop messages instead of completing subscriptions in the HTTP callback transport

When an HTTP callback subscription's internal buffer is full, acknowledge the callback and drop only that message instead of returning a 503 response and terminating the subscription. This aligns HTTP callback behavior with the other streaming transports and lets slow consumers recover without reconnecting.

#### Log lagged and dropped subscription messages at `debug` level

Reduce expected slow-consumer noise by changing logs for lagged client messages and messages dropped from full subscription buffers from `warn` to `debug`. These events no longer imply subscription termination and can be monitored through the subscription metrics.

#### Subgraph network/HTTP errors propagation

Improves how the router reacts to failed or malformed subgraph HTTP responses. Instead of silently ignoring the HTTP status and content-type, the router now emits a GraphQL error for the failing fetch. The affected field is set to `null` and partial results from other subgraphs are preserved.

| Subgraph response | Router behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `2xx`, valid content-type, valid GraphQL body | passed through unchanged |
| `2xx`, valid content-type, valid JSON but no `data`/`errors` | `SUBREQUEST_MALFORMED_RESPONSE` |
| `2xx`, valid content-type, body is not valid JSON | `SUBREQUEST_MALFORMED_RESPONSE` |
| `2xx`, missing or non-JSON content-type (e.g. `text/html`) | `SUBREQUEST_MALFORMED_RESPONSE` |
| Non-2xx status | `SUBREQUEST_HTTP_ERROR` (with `extensions.http.status`) |
| Transport/connection failure (no HTTP response) | `SUBREQUEST_HTTP_ERROR` |

## 0.0.81 (2026-07-07)

### Fixes

- Bump version - no changes

## 0.0.80 (2026-07-07)

### Features

#### Allow to bypass persisted document ID requirement

Add `hive::persisted_documents::skip_enforcement` request context flag. When set to `true`, the router skips the persisted document ID requirement. This allows requests with a full operation string to pass through even when `persisted_documents.require_id` is enabled.

The flag is writable from `OnHttpRequest` and `OnGraphqlParams` plugin hooks, and from the `router.request` coprocessor stage.

`persisted_documents.require_id` now accepts an expression in addition to a static boolean. The expression is evaluated per-request and supports request context (`.request.headers`, `.request.method`, `.request.url`) and the `env()` function for environment variables. When the expression returns `true`, the document ID requirement is enforced, when `false`, it is skipped for that request.

Example:

```yaml
persisted_documents:
  require_id:
    expression: |
      is_null(env("BYPASS_SECRET")) || .request.headers."x-bypass-require-id" != env("BYPASS_SECRET")
```

### Fixes

#### Query Planning performance improvements

Removed unused per-path edge tracking and switched to references instead of owned values - no cloning of selection items.

## 0.0.79 (2026-07-06)

### Fixes

#### Debug log message when subscription buffer consumer drops before producer stops

"Consumer for subgraph {} at {} dropped the receiver" was logged at `error` level, but it fires on the normal teardown path: once all clients unsubscribe/disconnect from a subscription, the broadcast channel closes, the pump task stops draining, and the mpsc receiver drops. This is expected cleanup, not a failure, so users were seeing noisy error logs for routine subscribe/unsubscribe churn.

Changed to `debug` level with a clearer message explaining it's expected shutdown of the upstream drain, not an actual error.

#### Fix stack overflow on cyclic fragment spreads with sibling fields or directives

A self-referential fragment that also selects a sibling field (`fragment A on Query { x ...A }`) or puts a directive on the cycling spread (`...A @include(if: $c)`) caused unbounded recursion during fragment inlining in normalization, overflowing the stack and crashing the process.

#### Fixed false circular dependency detection in case of `@requires`

We fixed a query planner bug that could make some valid federated queries fail.

The issue happened when planning fields with nested `@requires` data. The planner compared required selection sets using only the top-level field, ignoring the rest of the selection set. For example, `foo { bar }` and `foo { baz { qux } }` could both be treated as overlapping `foo`.

This could make the planner drop a valid way to fetch the required data too early.

### Fixes

#### Restrict indirect path finding to valid subgraphs

Fix an issue where query planning could appear stuck on some complex federated schemas due to excessive indirect path exploration.

Indirect path exploration happens when the planner cannot resolve a field directly in the current subgraph and starts searching for a route through other subgraphs that could satisfy the field and its requirements.

Indirect field lookup is now limited to subgraphs that can actually resolve the requested field, reducing unnecessary work and preventing planning stalls.

## 0.0.77 (2026-07-01)

### Fixes

#### Better detection of mutations in query-planner

When a mutation is encountered in an operation (e.g. `mutation { ... }`), the query planner needs to use `Sequence` instead of `Parallel` to ensure the mutation is executed in the correct order.

Previuosly, Hive Router was checking if `type Mutation` was used in the root step to determine if a mutation was present.

This change uses the actual incoming operation type (`mutation { ... }`) to determine if a mutation is present in a specific plan.

#### Fix root type re-entry

When a field re-exposes a root type from a nested position (e.g. a mutation field
returning a type with a `query: Query` field), the query planner could not resolve
selections that live in a different subgraph, and the executor merged whatever it
did fetch at the response root instead of the nested path — so those fields
resolved to `null`, or failed to resolve fully. 

Fixes [#1164](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1164)

### Fixes

### Features

#### Propagate subgraph `extensions` to the client response

Subgraph GraphQL responses can carry an `extensions` object that can now be forwarded to the final client response, controlled by config.

Extension keys set by the router or plugins take precedence over subgraph-propagated values at all times.

`first`/`last` ordering matches processing order, which is deterministic for sequential plan nodes and non-deterministic for parallel fetches (same behaviour as response header propagation).

### Configuration

```yaml
response_extensions:
  propagate:
    algorithm: last # first | last | append. default: last
    allow: # optional key whitelist. omit to allow all keys
      - foo
      - bar
```

`algorithm` controls how the same key is merged when multiple subgraphs return it:

- `first` - keep the first subgraph's value, ignore later ones.
- `last` - overwrite with the last subgraph's value (default).
- `append` - collect every value into an array, always an array even for a single value.

`allow` is an optional whitelist of top-level extension keys. When omitted, all keys propagate.

The key `queryPlan` is always blocked regardless of config.

### Examples

Two subgraphs both return `extensions.foo`:

```
subgraph a: { "extensions": { "foo": { "some": ["array"] } } }
subgraph b: { "extensions": { "foo": { "some": "object" } } }
```

With `algorithm: first`:

```json
{ "extensions": { "foo": { "some": ["array"] } } }
```

With `algorithm: last`:

```json
{ "extensions": { "foo": { "some": "object" } } }
```

With `algorithm: append`:

```json
{ "extensions": { "foo": [{ "some": ["array"] }, { "some": "object" }] } }
```

### Fixes

#### Prevent @requires creating a circular dependency across subgraphs

The Query Planner could hit a timeout when a field with `@requires` needed to move to another subgraph, and the move required the same fields.

#### Fix: Traverse fragments linearly during cycle validation and inlining

GraphQL fragments can spread other fragments, e.g. `fragment A on T { ...B }`. When fragments form a long acyclic chain (A spreads B, B spreads C, and so on for thousands of links), we walked that chain with plain recursion. 

This change prevents the stack from being filled in such cases.

### Fixes

#### Correctly process variables in introspection execution

Introspection resolution only handled inline literal arguments, so arguments
passed as variables (e.g. `__type(name: $name)` or `includeDeprecated: $flag`)
were ignored and resolved to their defaults.

The introspection context now carries the request variables.

Fixes [#1185](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1185)

#### Fix shared response keys leaking across disjoint fragments

When several fragments on different types selected the same response key with different sub-selections (e.g. `... on Article { meta { title } }` vs `... on Video { meta { wordCount } }`), the response projection merged their child selections together instead of keeping them per type.

As a result, a sub-field selected for one type could leak into the projection of another. 

When that leaked field was Non-Null and absent from the actual type's data, null propagation bubbled up and collapsed the whole response to `data: null`.

Fixes [#1166](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/pull/1166)

#### Fix missing `__typename` with `@requires` re-entry

Resolving a field with `@requires` makes the planner re-enter the entity's subgraph through `_entities`, using a representation built from the entity's data. That representation must carry the entity's `__typename`, since `_entities` routes on it.

The fetch that produces the entity now always selects its `__typename`, so the re-entry representation is complete.

Fixes [#1070](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1070)

#### Improve error handling when body limit reached

When rejecting a request whose `Content-Length` exceeds `max_request_body_size`, the router now drains a small bounded part of the request body before responding.

This lets the connection close cleanly so the client reliably receives the `413 Payload Too Large` response instead of a connection-reset/transport error.

#### Restrictive `Cache-Control` header merging

`Cache-Control` headers from all subgraph responses are now merged using the most conservative directive before being forwarded to the client. No configuration required.

### Merge algorithm

Given N subgraph responses:

1. Any `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `private` directive short-circuits the result to `no-store, no-cache`.
2. Otherwise `max-age` is the minimum of all present values (missing values are ignored).
3. `public` only when every subgraph is `public`.
4. `must-revalidate` if any subgraph sets it.

`no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` is forced regardless of subgraph headers when:

- Any subgraph executor error (network failure, bad status, etc.)
- Any GraphQL-level error in a subgraph response (`errors` array non-empty)
- The operation is a mutation

The `Cache-Control` header is removed entirely when no subgraph sends a valid one.

### Configuration

Enable merging by propagating `Cache-Control` through header rules:

```yaml
headers:
  all:
    response:
      - propagate:
          named: cache-control
          algorithm: append
          # default emitted unless a subgraph provides one
          default: "public, max-age=180"
```

Subgraph-level `insert` or `remove` rules let you pin or drop a specific subgraph's contribution before the merge runs:

```yaml
headers:
  subgraphs:
    pricing:
      response:
        - insert:
            name: cache-control
            value: "no-cache"
```

Configuring `propagate: named: cache-control` without the merge enabled is rejected at compile time. If no `Cache-Control` propagation is configured, merging is inactive.

## 0.0.72 (2026-06-19)

### Fixes

#### Make the subscription subgraph executor buffer capacity configurable

When a subscription is established, the router reads events from the subgraph (over HTTP streaming or WebSocket) and runs each one through entity resolution before fanning it out to listeners. A per-subscription buffer sits between the subgraph and that processing pipeline so the subgraph is never throttled when the router falls behind. When the buffer is full, the newest incoming event is dropped (and logged) instead of slowing down or tearing down the connection to the subgraph.

The size of this buffer is now configurable via `subscriptions.subgraph_buffer_capacity`. A larger capacity gives the router more headroom to absorb bursts at the cost of memory and potentially staler events under sustained backpressure; a smaller capacity keeps memory minimal and drops eagerly. It defaults to `1024`, favoring high throughput.

```yaml
subscriptions:
  enabled: true
  subgraph_buffer_capacity: 1024 # default
```

#### Decouple HTTP streaming subscriptions from downstream backpressure

When a subscription's events flow through the router, each event is run through entity resolution (fetching the related data from other subgraphs) before being delivered to the client. If that resolution is slow, or the client is slow to consume, the router would previously stop reading from the subscribing subgraph until it caught up. That stall propagates back over the connection and effectively throttles the subgraph's emitter.

HTTP streaming subscriptions (multipart and SSE) now buffer incoming events and drain them from the subgraph at full speed, independent of how fast the router can process them. If the router cannot keep up, the newest incoming event is dropped (and logged) instead of slowing the subgraph.

The subscription stays alive and the subgraph keeps emitting unaffected.

#### Keep WebSocket subgraph subscriptions alive under backpressure

Each subscription event the router receives is run through entity resolution (fetching related data from other subgraphs) before reaching the client. When that resolution has higher latency than the rate at which the subgraph emits events, the router falls behind and backpressure builds up.

The WebSocket subgraph executor now drops individual messages it cannot keep up with instead of tearing down the subscription, keeping the underlying connection to the subgraph open. The dropped messages are logged, and the subgraph continues emitting without being throttled by the router's processing speed.

## 0.0.71 (2026-06-18)

### Fixes

#### Fix null propagation in non-null fields

This change fixes the null propagation logic in non-null fields to match the spec.

From the GraphQL spec:

> Since Non-Null response positions cannot be null, execution errors are propagated to be handled by the parent response position. If the parent response position may be null then it resolves to null, otherwise if it is a Non-Null type, the execution error is further propagated to its parent response position.
> If a List type wraps a Non-Null type, and one of the response position elements of that list resolves to null, then the entire list response position must resolve to null. If the List type is also wrapped in a Non-Null, the execution error continues to propagate upwards.
> If every response position from the root of the request to the source of the execution error has a Non-Null type, then the "data" entry in the execution result should be null.

See [Handling Execution Errors](https://spec.graphql.org/September2025/#sec-Handling-Execution-Errors).

Fixes https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1154

Fixes https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1110

#### Log subgraph subscription failures at error level

Subgraph subscription failures (WebSocket handshake, HTTP-callback connect, SSE stream, etc.) are now logged at `error` level via the central `plan.rs` handler, matching how non-subscription subgraph errors are already logged. Previously these failures only reached the client; the router itself logged nothing above `debug`.

#### Improve handling of unions

The query planner improves handling of union types whose members vary between subgraphs. Previously, the planner always computed an intersection of union members, ignoring subgraph-specific members.

Fixes [#1098](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1098)

#### Mark failed subgraph HTTP requests as errors on their trace span

When an outgoing subgraph HTTP request failed at the transport level (connection error, timeout, body read failure, etc.), the `http.client` span was left with an unset `otel.status_code`, so the failure was not surfaced as an error in traces (e.g. Datadog). The error was only recorded in metrics. The span is now marked with `otel.status_code = "Error"` and the corresponding `error.type` on the failure path, matching the existing metrics behaviour.

## 0.0.70 (2026-06-17)

### Features

#### Add an experimental query planner option, `experimental_abstract_type_folding`

```yaml
query_planner:
    experimental_abstract_type_folding: true # false by default
```

Folds matching concrete object-type fragments in subgraph calls, into a shared interface fragment even when that interface is not the field's declared return type.

It's an opt-in addition to [`011be5b`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/commit/011be5bdbfb00bf1e415eb7a50e6be91f565ef05).

```diff
## queries `product-service` subgraph
query {
  products {
-    ... on Book  { id title }
-    ... on Movie { id title }
+    ... on Media { id title }
  }
}
```

The `products` field returns `Product` interface, but one object-type member of this interface called `Album` is not present in the query, therefore `... on Product {...}` is not possible to use (default behavior). With the feature flag enabled, both fragments are folded into `... on Media { ... }`, because `Book` and `Movie` are the only members of the `Media` interface in the `product-service` subgraph.

### Fixes

#### Fix Router's HTTP layer timeout

Hive Router has it's own timeout that's being enforced, but `ntex`'s one was still effective and uses the default settings.  

Instead of fully disabling the low-level timeout, this PR changes the Router implementation to configure `ntex` timeout to `router_timeout+1` so the safe guard is still in place.

#### Fix response header propagation on error paths

Response header rules now run consistently for successful responses, partial GraphQL error responses, deduped requests, and execution failures.

#### Avoid indirect lookup for directly resolved leaf fields

The planner now skips indirect path lookup when a leaf field already has a valid direct path.

### Features

#### Add at-least-once sampling for Usage Reporting

Hive Router now supports at-least-once sampling for Usage Reporting.

This feature is useful when you want to keep a low sampling rate, but still make sure all operations are visible in Hive at least once.

The first request for each unique key is always reported. Later requests for the same key follow the configured sampling `rate`.

Example configuration:

```yaml
telemetry:
  hive:
    usage_reporting:
      enabled: true
      sampling:
        rate: "10%" # 10% of operations will be reported
        at_least_once:
          key: # the combination of operation's name and body makes the request unique
            - operation_name
            - operation_body
          max_distinct_keys: 12000 # how many keys to track and hold in memory
```

Keys are tracked in memory, up to `max_distinct_keys` (default: `100_000`). Every key takes approximately 16 bytes of memory.

#### Apply usage-reporting excludes before sampling

Exclusion of Usage Reports is now evaluated before sampling. Excluded operations are dropped immediately and sampling is not affected.

#### Demand Control with `@cost` and `@listSize` directives

Add support for the [Demand Control specification](https://ibm.github.io/graphql-specs/cost-spec.html), allowing operators to limit the cost of incoming GraphQL operations using the `@cost` and `@listSize` directives.

The router now calculates the cost of incoming operations based on directive-driven type, field, and argument costs (with list-size estimation) and can reject operations that exceed a configured maximum. Both static (request) and actual (response) cost can be measured, and the behavior is configurable via the new `demand_control` section in the router configuration.

Telemetry is included: new metrics under `demand_control_metrics` and additional span attributes expose estimated/actual cost and rejection reasons for observability.

[Documentation for the feature is available here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/security/demand-control)

### Fixes

- Fixes batched entity fetching when the entity list contains null items

#### Fix: process initial GraphiQL variables

The Yoga GraphiQL wrapper reads query from the current URL, but it was not reading the variables URL parameter. 

This change now allows GraphiQL to process the `variables` from query parameters.

#### Move `sample_rate` into `sampling.rate`

**Breaking change** The sampling configuration of Usage Reporting has been reorganized.

```diff
telemetry:
  hive:
    usage_reporting:
-      sample_rate: "10%"
+      sampling:
+        rate: "10%"
```


The old top-level `sample_rate` field has been replaced by `sampling.rate`.

## 0.0.67 (2026-06-13)

### Fixes

- Update pinned `ntex` to latest
- Version bump and update `vrl` to latest

#### Fold repeated object-type selections into a single interface selection

When a `Fetch` node asks for the same fields on different object types, and all
of those types implement the same interface that matches the field's return type,
the query planner now merges them into a single inline fragment on the interface
instead of keeping separate branches.

For example: `query { media { ... on Book { id title } ... on Movie { id title } } }` becomes
`query { media { id title } }` when the field's return type is `Media` and both
`Book` and `Movie` implement it in the subgraph.

## 0.0.66 (2026-06-09)

### Fixes

#### Fix projection when only `__typename` is used as key

As described in [issue #1099](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1099), when an entity's `@key` is only `__typename` (e.g. `@key(fields: "__typename")`), the executor built a correct query plan but never issued the `_entities` request to the other subgraph, leaving the cross-subgraph field resolved as `null`.

The representation projection skipped the `__typename` field and only emitted it alongside other fields, so a key using only `__typename` field produced an empty representation and the entity fetch was silently dropped.

The projection now emits a `{ "__typename": ... }` representation in this case, so the entity fetch runs and the field resolves as expected.

## 0.0.65 (2026-06-03)

### Features

#### Path parameters from `http.graphql_endpoint`

Any path parameters captured from the configured pattern are now exposed:

- in expressions as `.request.path_params`
- in plugins through the existing `RouterHttpRequest.match_info`

```yaml
http:
  graphql_endpoint: /{tenant}/graphql
override_subgraph_urls:
  all:
    url:
      expression: |
        tenant = string!(.request.path_params.tenant)
        replace(string!(.default), "/api/", "/api/" + tenant + "/")
```

A request to `/acme/graphql` resolves `tenant` to `"acme"` before the expression runs.

#### BREAKING: `override_subgraph_urls.subgraphs` and global `all`

In `override_subgraph_urls` the per-subgraph overrides now live under a `subgraphs` field, alongside a new optional `all` override.

```yaml
## Before
override_subgraph_urls:
  accounts:
    url: "https://accounts.example.com/graphql"
  products:
    url:
      expression: |
        if .request.headers."x-region" == "us-east" {
          "https://products-us-east.example.com/graphql"
        } else {
          .default
        }

## After
override_subgraph_urls:
  subgraphs:
    accounts:
      url: "https://accounts.example.com/graphql"
    products:
      url:
        expression: |
          if .request.headers."x-region" == "us-east" {
            "https://products-us-east.example.com/graphql"
          } else {
            .default
          }
  all:
    url:
      expression: |
        if .subgraph.name == "reviews" {
          "https://reviews.example.com/graphql"
        } else {
          .default
        }
```

A single override under `override_subgraph_urls.all.url` is now applied to every subgraph that does not have its own per-subgraph override. This is useful when the override logic is the same for all subgraphs or depends on the current subgraph name.

The expression has access to:

- `.request`: the incoming HTTP request
- `.default`: the original subgraph URL from the supergraph SDL
- `.subgraph.name`: the name of the subgraph the URL is being resolved for

Per-subgraph entries under `subgraphs.<name>` always take precedence over `all`.

### Fixes

#### Fix GET request detection when Laboratory disabled

Hitting the router with a `GET` request from a browser was returning 404 when Laboratory is disabled. 

This change adds a check to only negotiate for Laboratory when Laboratory is enabled, and fallbacks to GET request handling when Laboratory is disabled.

#### Forward operation name to subgraphs

Added the `traffic_shaping.all.forward_operation_name` and `traffic_shaping.subgraphs.<name>.forward_operation_name` options. The option defaults to `false`.

The operation name is injected (opt-in) into the query document and the `operationName` JSON field, formatted as `<client_operation_name>__<fetch_step_id>`, when sending requests to subgraphs.

Global opt-in:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    forward_operation_name: true
```

Per-subgraph opt-in:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      # Overrides global setting for this subgraph
      forward_operation_name: true
```

#### Graceful handling of invalid Supergraph while polling

As described in [issue #1089](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/1089), when the Supergraph fails to parse, the internal mpsc channel should not panic or collapse. 

This fix prevents the Router from crashing when the Supergraph fails to parse, and keeps the channel alive for future updates. 

In case of an invalid Supergraph, the channel is not closed, allowing the Router to continue receiving updates, and the error is being logged. Also, a telemetry (metrics) event is being emitted to track the error.

#### Improve parsing of Router configuration

Improve error messages when parsing Router configuration, in cases where `SingleOrMultiple<T>` is used and parsing of `T` fails. 

The error is now visible to the user, instead of being swallowed and reported as a generic error.

## 0.0.64 (2026-06-01)

### Features

#### Expose `context` and `request_context` on `on_graphql_error`

The `on_graphql_error` plugin hook now holds the `PluginContext` and a
`RequestContextPluginApi<OnGraphqlError>` as `context` and `request_context`, matching other request-scoped hooks (`on_http_request`, `on_execute`, etc.).

#### Migration

`on_graphql_error` now has a generic over the request lifetime; signatures must be
updated from:

```rust
fn on_graphql_error(&self, mut payload: OnGraphQLErrorHookPayload) -> OnGraphQLErrorHookResult {
    // ...
}
```

to:

```rust
fn on_graphql_error<'req>(
    &'req self,
    mut payload: OnGraphQLErrorHookPayload<'req>,
) -> OnGraphQLErrorHookResult<'req> {
    // ...
}
```

### Fixes

#### Add `end_with_graphql_errors(...)` to the plugin hook API.

Plugin authors can now terminate execution with multiple GraphQL errors in a single response. This avoids forcing plugins to either return only one error or manually build a raw GraphQL error response when several errors should be reported together.

## 0.0.63 (2026-05-27)

#### Add tracing sampling rate environment override

The tracing sampling rate can now be overridden without editing the router config file:

```shell
TELEMETRY_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE=0.1
```

This sets the same value as the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    collect:
      sampling: 0.1
```

## 0.0.62 (2026-05-27)

### Fixes

#### Fix `VariablesInAllowedPosition` rejecting list-typed variables with a non-null default value

The router used to reject valid client queries that declared a list-typed variable with a non-null default value, for example:

```graphql
query Q($arg: [SomeEnum!] = SOME_VALUE) {
  field(arg: $arg)
}
```

with a `VariablesInAllowedPosition` validation error containing a malformed type:

```
Variable "$arg" of type "SomeEnum!!" used in position expecting type "[SomeEnum!]".
```

The rule used to compute the variable's effective type incorrectly when the variable was list-typed and had a non-null default value: it dropped the list wrapper and re-wrapped the inner element type in `NonNull`, producing the invalid `T!!` shape. Per [the spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-All-Variable-Usages-are-Allowed), a non-null default value makes the variable usable in a non-null position; the variable's effective type should be `NonNull(var_type)`, not `NonNull(element_type)`. So for `[SomeEnum!]` with a non-null default, the effective type is now correctly `[SomeEnum!]!` (and the query is accepted).

## 0.0.61 (2026-05-26)

### Features

#### External storage support (e.g S3)

[documentation](http://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/configuration/storages)

This release introduces a new top-level `storages` configuration and the first storage backend, s3, so the router can load external artifacts from object storage.

With this change, both the `supergraph` source and `persisted_documents` manifest can be resolved from a configured storage by reference. It also adds optional polling support so the router can reload updated content from storage without restarting.

Start by configuring the storage in your router config:

```yaml
storages: 
  my-s3: # this is the storage id 
    type: s3
    bucket: my-bucket
    region: eu-west-1
    # .. additional S3 configurations 
```

Then, you can use the storage id in your `supergraph` source:

```yaml
supergraph:
  source: storage
  storage_id: my-s3
  location: supergraphs/current.graphql
  poll_interval: 30s
```

Or, you can use the storage id in your `persisted_documents` manifest:

```yaml
persisted_documents:
  enabled: true
  require_id: true
  storage:
    type: storage
    storage_id: my-s3
    location: persisted/manifest.json
    poll_interval: 30s
```

### Fixes

#### Remove dependency ntex from console-sdk

Other pkgs are released due to minor refactor and code relocation.

#### Warn about debug binary in production use 

Added a warning message to the router binary to warn users about using a debug binary in production use.

This is intended to prevent cases where users accidentally use a debug binary in production, which can lead to performance issues.

This release pins `ntex` to `3.7.2` to avoid regressions, like the one reported in [#997](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/issues/997). 

Users who builds their own router are impacted by this regression, due to the way Cargo handles unpinned dependencies.

## 0.0.58 (2026-05-17)

### Fixes

#### Implement Circuit Breaker for Subgraph Requests

This change introduces a circuit breaker mechanism for subgraph requests in the Hive Router. The circuit breaker will monitor the success and failure rates of requests to each subgraph and will prevent future requests if the failure rate exceeds a certain threshold. When the circuit breaker is opened, subsequent requests to that subgraph will fail immediately without attempting to send the request.

This implementation helps improve the resilience and stability of the Hive Router when dealing with unreliable subgraphs.

#### Record subgraph execution errors on the `graphql.subgraph.operation` span

Errors raised while preparing or executing a subgraph fetch
(`PlanExecutionError`) are now attached to the corresponding
`graphql.subgraph.operation` span instead of only surfacing on the
top-level `graphql.operation` span via the response-error pipeline.

For each failing fetch the span now carries:
- `hive.graphql.error.count = 1`,
- `hive.graphql.error.codes` set to the error code (e.g.
  `SUBGRAPH_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `HEADER_PROPAGATION_FAILURE`,
  `SUBGRAPH_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REJECTED`, …), and
- a `graphql.error` event with `error.type`, `error.message`, and
  `hive.error.subgraph_name`.

Previously these subgraph-level spans looked "ok" even when the fetch
never produced a response, which was misleading in tracing UIs that
highlight failing spans. The error is now visible at the subgraph hop
where it actually originated.

## 0.0.57 (2026-05-13)

### Features

#### Allow overriding number of HTTP server workers

Adds a new `http.workers` configuration option (and `ROUTER_HTTP_WORKERS` environment variable) to control the number of HTTP server worker threads.

By default, the router spawns one worker per physical CPU core. In containerized environments such as Kubernetes the number of physical cores reported by the OS is often higher than the CPU limit assigned to the container, which leads to oversubscribed worker threads. Set `http.workers` (or `ROUTER_HTTP_WORKERS`) to match the container's CPU limit to avoid this.

```yaml
http:
  workers: 4
```

#### Add `cors.preflight_response_headers` to attach headers to CORS preflight (OPTIONS) responses

Adds a new optional `preflight_response_headers` map to the `cors` configuration block, and to each entry under `cors.policies`. The map allows attaching arbitrary headers (e.g. `Cache-Control`, `Server-Timing`, custom `X-*` headers) to CORS preflight (OPTIONS) responses.

This is useful because the `headers` configuration block does not affect preflight responses (they are returned early by the CORS layer), so there was previously no way to control headers like `Cache-Control` for `OPTIONS` requests.

Example:

```yaml
cors:
  enabled: true
  allow_any_origin: true
  max_age: 86400
  preflight_response_headers:
    Cache-Control: "public, max-age=86400"
```

## 0.0.55 (2026-05-11)

### Fixes

#### Escape inline string arguments when emitting subgraph operations

Fixes a bug where string values inlined as arguments in subgraph operations were not re-escaped per the GraphQL spec. When an incoming operation contained a string literal whose decoded value carried a quote or backslash (for example `payload: "\"quoted\""`), the router forwarded the argument to the subgraph as `payload: ""quoted""`, producing invalid GraphQL. The same went for newlines, tabs, and other control characters.

Now the characters are escaped properly per the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#StringCharacter).

## 0.0.54 (2026-05-11)

### Fixes

#### Fix subgraph response deserialization for custom scalar object

Values whose JSON keys contain escaped characters such as `\t` are now deserialized correctly.

#### Preserve custom scalars as raw JSON

Custom scalar fields marked by the query planner are now preserved as raw JSON instead of being parsed and rebuilt as structured response values. This improves correctness for JSON passthrough custom scalars while avoiding performance regressions for normal response handling.

## 0.0.53 (2026-05-08)

### Fixes

#### Fix conditional directive handling in response projection.

This fixes several edge cases where `@skip` and `@include` could produce an incorrect final response after query planning and projection planning.

## 0.0.52 (2026-05-05)

### Features

#### Improve HTTP server request OTel tracing with client and peer network attributes.

The `http.server` span now includes:
- `client.address` and `client.port` from a configurable request header
- `network.peer.address` and `network.peer.port` from the address of the incoming connection

```yaml
telemetry:
  client_identification:
    # Default - use socket peer only
    ip_header: null
    
    # Header name - use the left-most valid IP from the header
    ip_header: x-forwarded-for
    
    # Trusted proxies - only trust the header when the socket peer is trusted
    ip_header:
      name: x-forwarded-for
      trusted_proxies:
        - 10.0.0.0/8
        - 192.168.0.0/16
```

In trusted proxies scenario, the Router scans the configured header from right to left, skips trusted proxy IP ranges, and records the first non-trusted IP as `client.address`.
If no valid client IP can be resolved, the Router falls back to the socket peer address.

#### Coprocessors

Introduces Coprocessors as language agnostic way to extend Hive Router.

**Supports coprocessor stages:**
- `router.request`
- `router.response`
- `graphql.request`
- `graphql.analysis`
- `graphql.response`

**Stage capabilities:**
- include selected request/response fields in stage payloads (headers, body, context, and optional SDL depending on stage config)
- mutate request body/headers/context for downstream pipeline execution
- short-circuit and return an immediate HTTP response from a stage

**Transport and endpoint support:**
- `http://` and `unix://` (unix socket domain) endpoints
- http/1, http/2 and h2c protocols

**Error handling:**
- coprocessor failures map to server-side failures (500)
- client-facing GraphQL errors are masked as Internal server error
- structured error codes are preserved in GraphQL extensions.code
- detailed coprocessor failure reasons remain in server logs/telemetry only

**Adds coprocessor metrics:**
- hive.router.coprocessor.requests_total
- hive.router.coprocessor.duration
- hive.router.coprocessor.errors_total

#### Dynamic Exclusions

### Dynamic Exclusions in Hive Router

Hive Router now supports dynamic exclusions, allowing you to exclude specific requests from usage reporting based on custom logic. This feature is useful for scenarios where you want to skip telemetry for certain requests, such as health checks or specific endpoints.

The previous operation-name list format is still supported for backward compatibility.

#### Usage
```diff
- exclude: ['ExcludedOp']
+ exclude:
+   expression: '.request.operation.name == "ExcludedOp"'
```

Both of the following are valid and supported:

```yaml
## legacy format
exclude:
  - ExcludedOp

## dynamic expression format
exclude:
  expression: '.request.operation.name == "ExcludedOp"'
```

The details about expression context is documented in the [Hive Router documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/configuration/expressions).

### Dynamic Exclusions in Apollo Router

As in Hive Router, Apollo Router used to support only operation name based exclusions. With the new dynamic exclusions feature, you can now specify custom logic to exclude requests from usage reporting.


## New `add_report_with_request` method in Hive Console SDK

In order to support exclusions based on request properties, a new method `add_report_with_request` has been added to the Hive Console SDK. This method allows you to include the request information in the report, which can then be used in the dynamic exclusion logic.

### Fixes

- Upgrade Laboratory to v0.1.7
- Adjustments in operation's kind being Enum and not &'static str

#### Added missing `isRepeatable` on `type __Directive`

The router's introspection schema was resolving `isRepeatable`, but it did not appear in the public (consumer) schema, leading to validation errors when introspection schema was executed through Laboratory. 

This change adds the missing `isRepeatable: Boolean!` to `type __Directive`, according to the [GraphQL introspection spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/spec/Section%204%20--%20Introspection.md).

#### Avoid propagating `@include`/`@skip` conditions to unconditional fetches

Fixed query planner condition propagation logic to avoid wrapping unconditional fetches
in conditional blocks when merging steps. This ensures that fields without directives are
not incorrectly gated by conditions from other steps, allowing for correct execution of
queries with mixed conditional and unconditional selections.

#### enhancement: update lab to 0.1.6

##934 by @mskorokhodov

Update hive lab to 0.1.6 to support new query plan visualization + fetch settings

#### Fix fragments being dropped when multiple inline fragments target the same concrete type within an abstract type fragment.

Previously, when a query contained two or more inline fragments on the same concrete type nested inside an interface or union fragment, only the first fragment's fields were included in the query plan — all subsequent ones were silently dropped.

**Example query that previously returned only `title`:**

```graphql
query {
  films {
    ... on Node {
      ... on Film { title }
      ... on Film { director }
    }
  }
}
```

Both fields are now correctly returned.

#### Fix fragment handling

Fix fragment handling for some queries that use reusable fragments with conditional directives

## 0.0.51 (2026-04-27)

### Fixes

#### HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c) Support for Subgraph Connections

Adds support for HTTP/2 cleartext (h2c) connections between the router and subgraphs via the new `allow_only_http2` configuration flag. When enabled, the router uses HTTP/2 prior knowledge to communicate with subgraphs over plain HTTP without TLS.

This is useful in environments where subgraphs support HTTP/2 but TLS is not required, such as service meshes, internal networks, or sidecar proxies.

### Configuration

The flag can be set globally for all subgraphs or per-subgraph. Per-subgraph settings override the global default.

#### Global (all subgraphs)

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    allow_only_http2: true
```

#### Per-subgraph

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  subgraphs:
    accounts:
      allow_only_http2: true
```

The default value is `false`, preserving the existing behavior of using HTTP/1.1 for plain HTTP connections and negotiating HTTP/2 via ALPN for TLS connections.

## 0.0.50 (2026-04-20)

### Features

#### Persisted Documents

Introduces persisted documents support in Hive Router with configurable extraction and storage backends.

Supports extracting persisted document IDs from:
- `documentId` in request body (default)
- `documentId` in URL query params (default)
- Apollo-style `extensions.persistedQuery.sha256Hash` (default)
- custom `json_path` (for example `doc_id` or `extensions.anything.id`)
- custom `url_query_param` (for example `?doc_id=123`)
- custom `url_path_param` (for example `/graphql/:id`)

Order is configurable and evaluated top-to-bottom.

Supports persisted document resolution from:
- file manifests (Apollo and Relay KV styles)
- Hive CDN (via `hive-console-sdk`)

File storage includes watch mode by default (with 150ms debounce) to reload manifests after file changes.
Hive storage validates document ID syntax before generating CDN paths to avoid silent invalid-path behavior.

Adds persisted-documents metrics:

- `hive.router.persisted_documents.extract.missing_id_total`
- `hive.router.persisted_documents.storage.failures_total`

These help track migration progress and resolution failures in production

#### TLS Support

Adds TLS support to Hive Router for both client and subgraph connections, including mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. This allows secure communication between clients, the router, and subgraphs by encrypting data in transit and optionally verifying identities.

#### TLS Directions

TLS Support has implementations for the following 4 directions:

##### Router -> Client - Regular TLS
Router has an `identity` (`cert`, `key`), and client has `cert`, then Client validates the router's `identity`

##### Client -> Router - mTLS
Router has the `cert`, client has the `identity`, mTLS/Client Auth then the router validates the client's `identity`

##### Subgraph -> Router - Regular TLS
Subgraph has the `identity` (`cert`, `key`), and router has `cert`, then Router validates the subgraph's `identity`.

##### Router -> Subgraph - mTLS
Subgraph has the `cert`, router(which is the client this time) has the `identity`, then subgraph validates the router's `identity`.

#### TLS Directions Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["Client"]
    Router["Router"]

    %% Router -> Client: Regular TLS
    Router -- "TLS\n(cert_file + key_file)" --> Client
    Client -. "validates router identity\n(cert_file)" .-> Router

    %% Client -> Router: mTLS / Client Auth
    Client -- "mTLS\n(client identity)" --> Router
    Router -. "validates client identity\n(client_auth.cert_file)" .-> Client

    %% Subgraph -> Router: Regular TLS
    Subgraph -- "TLS\n(cert_file)" --> Router
    Router -. "validates subgraph identity\n(all/subgraphs.cert_file)" .-> Subgraph

    %% Router -> Subgraph: mTLS
    Router -- "mTLS\n(client_auth.cert_file + key_file)" --> Subgraph
    Subgraph -. "validates router identity\n(cert_file)" .-> Router
```

#### Configuration Structure
```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  router:
    key_file:          # Router server private key
    cert_file:         # Router server certificate(s)
    client_auth:       # mTLS: Client -> Router
       cert_file:      # Trusted client CA certificate(s)
  all:                 # Default TLS for all subgraph connections
    cert_file:         # Trusted subgraph CA certificate(s)
    client_auth:       # mTLS: Router -> Subgraph
       cert_file:      # Router client certificate(s)
       key_file:       # Router client private key
  subgraphs:
    SUBGRAPH_NAME:     # Per-subgraph TLS override
      cert_file:       # Trusted subgraph CA certificate(s)
      client_auth:     # mTLS: Router -> Subgraph
         cert_file:    # Router client certificate(s)
         key_file:     # Router client private key
```

### Fixes

#### Plugin System API improvements

Expose `EarlyHTTPResponse` instead of `PlanExecutionOutput` in the hooks that do not have internal fields like `response_headers_aggregator` etc, and it is easier to construct an HTTP response with a body, header map and status code.

```rust
payload.end_with_response(
    EarlyHTTPResponse {
        body,
        headers,
        status_code,
    }
);
```

#### Adds an optional `graphiql` Cargo feature for `hive-router`.

When enabled, the Router serves GraphiQL HTML and skips Laboratory asset generation so `npm` and `node` dependencies are not needed.
By default, this feature is disabled and existing Laboratory behavior is unchanged.

```bash
cargo run -p hive-router --features graphiql
cargo build -p hive-router --features graphiql
```

#### Negative Cache and Single-Flight

Introduced single-flight resolution of documents in the SDK.

Added a negative cache to store non 2XX requests for 5s (configurable, but in SDK it's disabled by default). It's meant to not keep repeating the same requests that eventually give errors or 404s.

#### Fix query planner handling for combined `@skip` and `@include` conditions.

- Preserve both directives when converting inline fragment conditions into fetch step selections
- Build the expected nested condition nodes for combined skip/include execution paths
- Handle `SkipAndInclude` in selection matching, fetch-step rendering, and multi-type batch path hashing
- Add regression snapshot tests for field-level and fragment-level combined conditions

For example a query like this:

```graphql
query($skip: Boolean!, $include: Boolean!) {
  user {
    name @skip(if: $skip) @include(if: $include)
  }
}
```

Will now correctly generate a fetch step with an inline fragment that has both `@skip` and `@include` conditions, and the planner will properly evaluate the combined conditions when determining which selections to include in the execution plan.

- `@skip(if: $skip)` is true, the selection will be skipped regardless of the `@include` condition.
- `@include(if: $include)` is false, the selection will be skipped regardless of the `@skip` condition.
- Only if `@skip(if: $skip)` is false and `@include(if: $include)` is true, the selection will be included in the execution plan.

### Features

#### Federated GraphQL Subscriptions

Hive Router now supports federated GraphQL subscriptions with full protocol coverage across [SSE](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/subscriptions/sse), [WebSockets](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/subscriptions/websockets), [Multipart HTTP](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/subscriptions/multipart-http), [Incremental Delivery](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/subscriptions/incremental-delivery), and [HTTP Callback](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/subscriptions/http-callback) - for both client-to-router and router-to-subgraph communication. Subscription events spanning multiple subgraphs are resolved automatically: when a subscription field lives in one subgraph but the response includes entity fields owned by others, the router fetches those on every event with no extra configuration.

## 0.0.47 (2026-04-13)

### Fixes

- correct timeout error message (#901)
- Version bump to fix release issues

#### Fix timeout error message to include the timeout duration instead of the endpoint URL

Previously by mistake, the error message for subgraph request timeouts included the endpoint URL instead of the timeout duration like `Request to subgraph timed out after http://ACCOUNT_ENDPOINT:PORT/accounts milliseconds`. This change simplifies the error message like `Request to subgraph timed out`.

#### Fix planning for conditional inline fragments and field conditions

Fixed a query-planner bug where directive-only inline fragments (using `@include`/`@skip` without an explicit type condition) could fail during normalization/planning for deeply nested operations.

This update improves planner handling for conditional selections and adds regression tests to prevent these failures in the future.

#### Replace GraphiQL with Hive Laboratory

The Laboratory is Hive's powerful GraphQL playground that provides a comprehensive environment for exploring, testing, and experimenting with your GraphQL APIs. Whether you're developing new queries, debugging issues, or sharing operations with your team, the Laboratory offers all the tools you need.

## 0.0.43 (2026-03-26)

### Features

#### Add router-level in-flight request deduplication for GraphQL queries

The router now supports deduplicating identical incoming GraphQL query requests while they are in flight, so concurrent duplicates can share one execution result.

### Configuration

A new router traffic-shaping section is available:

- `traffic_shaping.router.dedupe.enabled` (default: `false`)
- `traffic_shaping.router.dedupe.headers` as `all`, `none`, or `{ include: [...] }` (default: `all`)

Supported header config shapes:

```yaml
headers: all
```

```yaml
headers: none
```

```yaml
headers:
  include:
    - authorization
    - cookie
```

Header names are validated and normalized as standard HTTP header names.

### Deduplication key behavior

The router dedupe fingerprint includes:

- request method and path
- selected request headers (based on dedupe header policy)
- normalized operation hash
- GraphQL variables hash
- schema checksum
- GraphQL extensions

### Features

#### Introduce BatchFetch for compatible entity fetches to improve query performance

When multiple `Flatten(Fetch)` steps target the same subgraph and have compatible shape, the planner can group them into one batched fetch operation with aliases.

Batching keeps execution depth the same, but **reduces request fanout**.
In our benchmark query, **downstream requests drop from `13` to `7`** while the number of execution waves stays unchanged.
This should also reduce pressure on subgraphs, because entities are resolved in one batched subgraph call instead of being resolved across multiple incoming GraphQL requests, where the lack of DataLoader or another caching layer could otherwise cause duplicate resolution work.

Before: 

```graphql
Parallel {
  Flatten(path: "products.@") {
    Fetch(service: "inventory") {
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      } =>
      {
        ... on Product {
          shippingEstimate
        }
      }
    }
  }
  Flatten(path: "topProducts.@") {
    Fetch(service: "inventory") {
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      } =>
      {
        ... on Product {
          shippingEstimate
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After:

```graphql
BatchFetch(service: "inventory") {
  {
    _e0 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
        "topProducts.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
  }
  {
    _e0: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        shippingEstimate
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When two entity fetches go to the same subgraph but request different output fields, they are batched into one `BatchFetch` node with two aliases, but share the same variables, to reduce the payload size.

```
BatchFetch(service: "inventory") {
  {
    _e0 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
    _e1 {
      paths: [
        "products.@"
      ]
      {
        ... on Product {
          upc
        }
      }
    }
  }
  {
    _e0: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        shippingEstimate
      }
    }
    _e1: _entities(representations: $__batch_reps_0) {
      ... on Product {
        inStock
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Features

- metrics  (#770)
- support multiple endpoints in `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` environment variable (#834)

#### Metrics with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus

This release adds support for OpenTelemetry metrics. In addition to existing tracing support, the router can now collect detailed metrics about HTTP and GraphQL activity and export them to a Prometheus endpoint or to an OTLP collector.

- Telemetry configuration now has a `metrics` section. Users can enable metrics exporters and tune histogram buckets under `telemetry.metrics` in `router.config.yaml`. By default metrics are disabled, so existing configurations continue to work unchanged.
- **Prometheus exporter** exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that follows the standard Prometheus text format. It can be attached to Router's http server or run on its own port. 
- **OTLP exporter** is available for sending metrics to an OpenTelemetry collector via gRPC or HTTP.
- **Instrumentation for every stage of the pipeline** - parsing, normalization, validation, planning and execution.
- **HTTP client/server metrics** - Router records metrics for incoming HTTP requests (latencies, sizes and status codes) and for outbound subgraph requests. These instruments follow the OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic conventions, making them usable out‑of‑the‑box with observability backends.
- **Supergraph reload metrics** - polling and reloading the supergraph is measured with poll counts, durations and errors, giving visibility into slow or failed schema reloads.

**Example configuration**

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    exporters:
      - prometheus:
          enabled: true
          # optional custom path (default `/metrics`)
          path: /metrics
          # serve on this port
          port: 9090
      - otlp:
          enabled: true
          # An absolute path to the OpenTelemetry collector
          endpoint: "http://otel-collector:4317"
          # protocol can be `grpc` or `http`
          protocol: http

      instruments:
        # Disable HTTP server request duration metric

### Fixes

#### Support multiple endpoints for Hive Console CDN source for Supergraph.

So you can pass endpoints separated by comma in the env var `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT`, so that if one CDN endpoint is not available, the router can fallback to the next one in the list.

```
HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT=https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/***,https://cdn-mirror.graphql-hive.com/***
```

## 0.0.40 (2026-03-05)

### Features

- plugin system (#628)

#### Plugin System

This release introduces a Plugin System that allows users to extend the functionality of Hive Router by creating custom plugins.

```rust
use hive_router::plugins::plugin_trait::RouterPlugin;
use hive_router::async_trait;
 
struct MyPlugin;
 
##[async_trait]
impl RouterPlugin for MyPlugin {
    type Config = ();
 
    fn plugin_name() -> &'static str {
        "my_plugin"
    }
}
```

You can learn more about the plugin system in the [technical documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/plugin-system) and in [Extending the Router guide](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/guides/extending-the-router).

This new feature also exposes many of the Router's internals through the [`hive-router` crate](https://crates.io/crates/hive-router).

### Fixes

- export `BackgroundTask` from `hive-router` crate (#797)
- resolve missing fields in introspection (#802)

#### Improve Query Plans for abstract types

The query planner now combines fetches for multiple matching types into a single fetch step.
Before, the planner could create one fetch per type.
Now, it can fetch many types together when possible, which reduces duplicate fetches and makes query plans more efficient.

#### Adds `noop_otlp_exporter` feature for internal usage

Hive Router uses `noop_otlp_exporter` internally for testing purposes. This change adds the `noop_otlp_exporter` feature to the `hive-router` crate so that it can be used internally while testing the router.

#### Rename internal query-plan path segment from `Cast(String)` to `TypeCondition(Vec<String>)`

Query Plan shape changed from `Cast(String)` to `TypeCondition(Vec<String>)`.
The `TypeCondition` name better reflects GraphQL semantics (`... on Type`) and avoids string encoding/decoding like `"A|B"` in planner/executor code.

**What changed**
- Query planner path model now uses `TypeCondition` terminology instead of `Cast`.
- Type conditions are represented as a list of type names, not a pipe-delimited string.
- Node addon query-plan typings were updated accordingly:
  - `FetchNodePathSegment.TypenameEquals` now uses `string[]`
  - `FlattenNodePathSegment` now uses `TypeCondition: string[]` (instead of `Cast: string`)

#### Dependencies Updates

- Update `rustls`, `aws-lc-rs` and `aws-lc-sys` dependencies to address `PKCS7` CVE in `aws-lc` crates.
- Update `rand` to latest version.

#### Fix missing elements in the introspection;

- `isDeprecated` and `deprecationReason` fields in introspection results for input values. This caused deprecated input values to be treated as non-deprecated, which could lead to clients not being aware of deprecations and potentially using deprecated fields or arguments.

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "SomeInputType") {
    inputFields {
      name
      isDeprecated # This field was missing, causing deprecated input values to be treated as non-deprecated
    }
  }
}
```

- `isOneOf` field in introspection results for input object types. This field indicates whether an input object type is a "oneOf" type, which is a special kind of input object that allows only one of its fields to be provided. The absence of this field could lead to clients not being able to correctly identify and handle "oneOf" input object types.

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "SomeInputObjectType") {
    name
    kind
    isOneOf # This field was missing, causing clients to not be able to identify "oneOf" input object types
  }
}
```

- `defaultValue` field in introspection results for input values and arguments. This field provides the default value for an argument if it is not provided in a query. The absence of this field could lead to clients not being aware of default values for arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior when executing queries that rely on default argument values.

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "SomeType") {
    fields {
      name
      args {
        name
        defaultValue # This field was missing, causing clients to not be aware of default argument values
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Add missing `specifiedByURL` field in introspection results for custom scalar types. This field provides a URL that specifies the behavior of a custom scalar type. The absence of this field could lead to clients not being able to understand the semantics of custom scalar types, which could result in incorrect handling of values of those types.

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "SomeCustomScalar") {
    name
    kind
    specifiedByURL # This field was missing, causing clients to not be able to understand the semantics of custom scalar types
  }
}
```

#### Internal GraphQL Validation Cache Key

- `ConsumerSchema` and `ValidationPlan` now implement `hash` property, which is calculated based on the SDL string of the consumer schema and the validation rules when the struct is created or when a new rule is added to the validation plan.
- Validation cache key is generated by hashing the SDL string of the consumer schema, and the validation rules together with the operation itself.
- All schema AST nodes now implement `Hash` trait, which allows us to hash the entire schema AST when generating the validation cache key.

## 0.0.39 (2026-02-12)

### Fixes

- Make `hive.inflight.key` span attribute unique per inflight group, for better identification of the leader and joiners in a distributed system.

## 0.0.38 (2026-02-11)

### Features

#### Move `telemetry.hive.endpoint` to `telemetry.hive.tracing.endpoint`.

The endpoint is tracing-specific, but its current placement at `telemetry.hive.endpoint` suggests it applies globally to all Hive telemetry features. This becomes misleading now that usage reporting also defines its own endpoint configuration (`telemetry.hive.usage_reporting.endpoint`).

```diff
telemetry:
  hive:
-   endpoint: "<value>"
+   tracing:
+     endpoint: "<value>"
```

## 0.0.37 (2026-02-10)

### Features

- request timeout (#753)

#### New configuration option to set a timeout for the router

This update introduces a new configuration option that allows users to set a timeout for the router. This timeout will help prevent long-running requests from consuming resources indefinitely, improving the overall performance and reliability of the router. Users can now specify a timeout duration in their configuration files, and the router will automatically terminate any requests that exceed this duration.

By default, the timeout is set to 60 seconds;

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
    router:
        request_timeout: 60s # Human readable duration format (e.g., "30s", "1m", "2h")
```

### Fixes

#### Hive telemetry (tracing and usage reporting) is now explicitly opt-in.

Two new environment variables are available to control telemetry:
  - `HIVE_TRACING_ENABLED` controls `telemetry.hive.tracing.enabled` config value
  - `HIVE_USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED` controls `telemetry.hive.usage_reporting.enabled` config value
  
The accepted values are `true` or `false`.

If you only set `HIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `HIVE_TARGET`, usage reporting stays disabled until explicitly enabled with environment variables or configuration file.

#### Tracing with OpenTelemetry

Introducing comprehensive OpenTelemetry-based tracing to the Hive Router, providing deep visibility into the GraphQL request lifecycle and subgraph communications.

- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Support for OTLP exporters (gRPC and HTTP) and standard propagation formats (Trace Context, Baggage, Jaeger, B3/Zipkin).
- **GraphQL-Specific Spans**: Detailed spans for every phase of the GraphQL lifecycle
- **Hive Console Tracing**: Native integration with Hive Console for trace visualization and analysis.
- **Semantic Conventions**: Support for both stable and deprecated OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic conventions to ensure compatibility with a wide range of observability tools.
- **Optimized Performance**: Tracing is designed with a "pay only for what you use" approach. Overhead is near-zero when disabled, and allocations/computations are minimized when enabled.
- **Rich Configuration**: New configuration options for telemetry exporters, batching, and resource attributes.

#### Unified Hive Telemetry Configuration

Refactored the configuration structure to unify Hive-specific telemetry (tracing and usage reporting) and centralize client identification.

- **Unified Hive Config**: Moved `usage_reporting` under `telemetry.hive.usage_reporting`. Usage reporting now shares the `token` and `target` configuration with Hive tracing, eliminating redundant settings.
- **Centralized Client Identification**: Introduced `telemetry.client_identification` to define client name and version headers once. These are now propagated to both OpenTelemetry spans and Hive usage reports.
- **Enhanced Expression Support**: Both Hive token and target ID now support VRL expressions for usage reporting, matching the existing behavior of tracing.

#### Breaking Changes:

The top-level `usage_reporting` block has been moved. 

**Before:**
```yaml
usage_reporting:
  enabled: true
  access_token: "..."
  target_id: "..."
  client_name_header: "..."
  client_version_header: "..."
```

**After:**
```yaml
telemetry:
  client_identification:
    name_header: "..."
    version_header: "..."
  hive:
    token: "..."
    target: "..."
    usage_reporting:
      enabled: true
```

## 0.0.36 (2026-02-06)

### Features

- Operation Complexity - Limit Aliases (#746)
- Operation Complexity - Limit Aliases (#749)
- configuration to limit the HTTP request body (#729)

### Fixes

#### New Operation Complexity Option: Max Aliases

We've introduced a new configuration option, `max_aliases` that allows you to limit the number of aliases in the incoming GraphQL operations. This helps to prevent overly complex queries that could impact performance, or any potential DOS attack or heap overflow via excessive aliases.

```yaml
limits:
  max_aliases:
    n: 3  # Set the maximum number of aliases allowed in a query
```

#### New configuration flag to limit the incoming HTTP request body size in the router before parsing the request(JSON etc).

```yaml
limits:
  max_request_body_size: 2MB # Human readable size format
```

By default, this limit is set to 2MB.

## 0.0.35 (2026-01-27)

### Features

- support multiple Hive CDN endpoints (#718)

### Fixes

- Bump version to fix release and dependencies issues

#### Support multiple endpoints in Hive CDN Supergraph config

In order to support a Secondary CDN endpoint for better reliability, the Hive CDN Supergraph configuration has been updated to allow specifying either a single endpoint or multiple endpoints.
This change enables users to provide a list of CDN endpoints, enhancing the robustness of their supergraph setup.

[Learn more about it in the relevant Hive Console documentation here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/schema-registry/high-availability-resilence).

```diff
supergraph:
    source: hive
-    endpoint: https://cdn-primary.example.com/supergraph
+    endpoint:
+       - https://cdn-primary.example.com/supergraph
+       - https://cdn-secondary.example.com/supergraph
```

#### Fix release issues and conflicts

- Re-export `graphql-tools` from `hive-console-sdk` to make it easier to depend directly on the SDK instead of an external package.

#### Fixed: 4xx client errors are now properly treated as errors and trigger endpoint failover, instead of being returned as successful responses.

This ensures the CDN fallback mechanism works correctly when endpoints return client errors like 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found.

## 0.0.34 (2026-01-26)

### Fixes

- Render GraphiQL when accepting text/html with highest q-weight (#705)
- avoid `expect` and handle configuration errors better (#715)
- Render GraphiQL when accepting text/html with highest q-weight

#### Better pipeline error handling

- Now there is only one place that logs the pipeline errors instead of many
- Pipeline errors are now mapped automatically from the internal error types using `#[from]` from `thiserror` crate instead of `map_err` everywhere

#### Better error handling for configuration loading

- In case of an invalid environment variables, do not crash with `panic` but provide a clear error message with a proper error type.
- In case of failing to get the current working directory, provide a clear error message instead of crashing with `panic`.
- In case of failing to parse the configuration file path, provide a clear error message instead of crashing with `panic`.

## 0.0.33 (2026-01-22)

### Features

- Query Complexity: Max Depth, Max Directives, Max Tokens (#623)
- Enable/Disable Introspection with `introspection` (#655)

#### New Query Complexity Configuration in `hive-router` and `hive-router-config`

We have introduced a new configuration module for query complexity in the Hive Router. 

This includes new validation rules to enforce maximum query depth, maximum number of directives in the incoming GraphQL operation, helping to prevent overly complex queries that could impact performance.

### Max Depth

By default, it is disabled, but you can enable and configure it in your router configuration as follows:

```yaml
limits:
  max_depth:
    n: 10  # Set the maximum allowed depth for queries
```

This configuration allows you to set a maximum depth for incoming GraphQL queries, enhancing the robustness of your API by mitigating the risk of deep-nested queries.

### Max Directives

You can also limit the number of directives in incoming GraphQL operations. This is also disabled by default. You can enable and configure it as follows:

```yaml
limits:
  max_directives:
    n: 5  # Set the maximum allowed number of directives
```

This configuration helps to prevent excessive use of directives in queries, which can lead to performance issues.

### Max Tokens

Additionally, we have introduced a new configuration option to limit the maximum number of tokens in incoming GraphQL operations. This feature is designed to prevent excessively large queries that could impact server performance.

By default, this limit is disabled. You can enable and configure it in your router configuration as follows:

```yaml
limits:
  max_tokens:
    n: 1000  # Set the maximum allowed number of tokens
```

This configuration allows you to set a maximum token count for incoming GraphQL queries, helping to ensure that queries remain manageable and do not overwhelm the server.

With these new configurations, you can better manage the complexity of incoming GraphQL queries and ensure the stability and performance of your API.

#### Refactor Router Initialization Error Handling in `hive-router`

- New `RouterInitError` enum to represent initialization errors in the Hive Router.
- `router_entrypoint` now returns `Result<(), RouterInitError>` instead of a boxed dynamic error(`Box<dyn std::error::Error>`), providing more specific error handling during router initialization.

### Fixes

- Expose query plan with option "dry-run" wont execute the query plan

#### Refactor Parse Error Handling in `graphql-tools`

Breaking;
- `ParseError(String)` is now `ParseError(InternalError<'static>)`.
- - So that the internals of the error can be better structured and more informative, such as including line and column information.
- `ParseError`s are no longer prefixed with "query parse error: " in their Display implementation.

## 0.0.32 (2026-01-16)

### Fixes

#### Add `minify_query_document` for optimized query minification

Implements `minify_query_document` to minify parsed GraphQL operations directly, avoiding the need for an intermediate `Display` step. This new approach uses `itoa` and `ryu` for efficient integer and float formatting.

By minifying the query document representation instead of the query string, we achieve performance improvements: query minification time is reduced from 4μs to 500ns, and unnecessary allocations are eliminated.

Includes benchmarks and tests to validate the performance gains and correctness of the new implementation.

#### Use native TLS instead of vendored

In this release, we've changed the TLS settings to use `native` TLS certificates provided by the OS, instead of using certificates that are bundled (`vendored`) into the router binary. 

This change provides more flexibiliy to `router` users, as you can extend and have full control over the certificates used to make subgraph requests, by extending or changing the certificates installed on your machine, or Docker container.

The `router` is using [AWS-LC](https://aws.amazon.com/security/opensource/cryptography/) as the certificate library.

### If you are using `hive-router` Crate

If you're using the `hive-router` crate as a library, the router provides the `init_rustls_crypto_provider()` function that automatically configures AWS-LC as the default cryptographic provider. You can call this function early in your application startup before initializing the router. Alternatively, you can configure your own `rustls` provider before calling router initialization. See the [`rustls` documentation](https://github.com/rustls/rustls#cryptography-providers) for instructions on setting up a custom provider.

## 0.0.31 (2026-01-15)

### Fixes

- Downgrade `reqwest` to `v0.12` to avoid runtime crash from `rustls` `CryptoProvider` introduced in reqwest `v0.13`.

## 0.0.30 (2026-01-14)

### Fixes

#### Update `reqwest`, `reqwest-retry`, and `reqwest-middleware` dependencies

This change updates the `reqwest` dependency to version `0.13.0`, `reqwest-retry` to version `0.9.0`, and `reqwest-middleware` to version `0.5.0` in the Hive Console SDK and Router packages.

#### Improved Performance for Expressions

This change introduces "lazy evaluation" for contextual information used in expressions (like dynamic timeouts).

Previously, the Router would prepare and clone data (such as request details or subgraph names) every time it performed an operation, even if that data wasn't actually needed.
Now, this work is only performed "on-demand" - for example, only if an expression is actually being executed.
This reduces unnecessary CPU usage and memory allocations during the hot path of request execution.

#### Moves `graphql-tools` to router repository

This change moves the `graphql-tools` package to the Hive Router repository.

## Own GraphQL Parser

This change also introduces our own GraphQL parser (copy of `graphql_parser`), which is now used across all packages in the Hive Router monorepo. This allows us to have better control over parsing and potentially optimize it for our specific use cases.

#### Moves hive-console-sdk to router repository

This change moves the `hive-console-sdk` package to the Hive Router repository.

#### Remove extra `target_id` validation in Router config

This change removes the extra deserialization validation for the `target_id` field in the Router configuration, because it is already done by the Hive Console SDK.

## 0.0.29 (2026-01-12)

### Fixes

#### Bump hive-router-config version

Somehow the `hive-router-internal` crate was published with an older version of the `hive-router-config` dependency.

## 0.0.28 (2026-01-12)

### Features

- allow to customize gql endpoint (#649)

### Fixes

#### Added an option to customize the GraphQL endpoint path

You can now customize the GraphQL endpoint path by adding the following configuration to your router configuration file:

```yaml
http:
  graphql_endpoint: /my-graphql-endpoint
```

#### Improve JSON response serialization

This PR significantly improves JSON response serialization (response projection) performance (50% faster) by replacing the existing character-by-character string escaping logic with a SIMD-accelerated implementation adapted from [sonic-rs](https://github.com/cloudwego/sonic-rs).

#### Fixed response projection for fields on different concrete types of interfaces and unions.

When a query included fragments on an abstract type (interface or union) that selected fields with the same name but different return types, the projection would incorrectly use a single, merged plan for all types. This caused projection to fail when processing responses where different concrete types had different field implementations.

For example, with `... on A { children { id } }` and `... on B { children { id } }` where `A.children` returns `[AChild]` and `B.children` returns `[BChild]`, the projection would fail to correctly distinguish between the types and return incomplete or incorrect data.

The fix introduces type-aware plan merging, which preserves the context of which concrete types a field came from. During response projection, the type is now determined dynamically for each object, ensuring the correct field type is used.

In addition, a refactor of the response projection logic was performed to improve performance.

## 0.0.27 (2026-01-07)

### Features

#### Make JWK algorithm optional

Make the JWK algorithm optional as it is defined as such in the RFC. To handle a missing algorithm, we fall back to reading the algorithm from the user JWT. To protect against forged tokens, we add a validation that the algorithm in the token is part of the `allowed_algorithms`. Since `JwkMissingAlgorithm` is not longer an error, the field is removed.

### Fixes

#### Internal refactoring of JWT handling

Passing mutable request reference around was the unnecessary use of `req.extensions` to pass `JwtContext`. 

Instead, we can directly pass `JwtContext` as-is instead of using `req.extensions`.

## 0.0.26 (2025-12-12)

### Features

#### Support environment variables in expressions

We have added support for using environment variables in expressions within the Hive Router configuration.

Example usage:
```
headers:
  all:
    response:
      - insert:
          name: "x-powered-by"
          expression: env("SERVICE_NAME", "default-value")
```

### Fixes

- bump hive-console-sdk (#617)
- Bump Hive Console SDK to fix the bug where reports are not being sent when client name is provided without a version
- Bump `vrl` dependency to `0.29.0`

## 0.0.25 (2025-12-11)

### Fixes

- chore: Enable publishing of internal crate

## 0.0.24 (2025-12-11)

### Fixes

- strip `@join__directive` and `join__DirectiveArguments` for the public consumer schema (#606)
- Strip `@join__directive` and `join__DirectiveArguments` internal types while creating the consumer/public schema

#### Extract expressions to hive-router-internal crate

The `expressions` module has been extracted from `hive-router-executor` into the `hive-router-internal` crate. This refactoring centralizes expressions handling, making it available to other parts of the project without depending on the executor.

It re-exports the `vrl` crate, ensuring that all consumer crates use the same version and types of VRL.

#### Prevent planner failure when combining conditional directives and interfaces

Fixed a bug where the query planner failed to handle the combination of conditional directives (`@include`/`@skip`) and the automatic `__typename` injection required for abstract types.

## 0.0.23 (2025-12-08)

### Fixes

- Bump dependencies

## 0.0.22 (2025-11-28)

### Features

- Hive Console Usage Reporting (#499)

### Fixes

- make supergraph.{path,key,endpoint} optional (#593)

#### Improve error messages and fix environment variable support for supergraph configuration

- **Fix:** Previously, `supergraph.path` (for file source), and `supergraph.endpoint`/`supergraph.key` (for Hive CDN source) were mandatory in the configuration file. This prevented users from relying solely on environment variables (`SUPERGRAPH_FILE_PATH`, `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT`, `HIVE_CDN_KEY`). This has been fixed, and these fields are now optional in the configuration file if the corresponding environment variables are provided.
- **Improved Error Reporting:** If the supergraph file path or Hive CDN endpoint/key are missing from both configuration and environment variables, the error message now explicitly guides you to set the required environment variable or the corresponding configuration option.

This change ensures that misconfigurations are easier to diagnose and fix during startup.

#### Usage Reporting to Hive Console

Hive Router now supports sending usage reports to the Hive Console. This feature allows you to monitor and analyze the performance and usage of your GraphQL services directly from the Hive Console.
To enable usage reporting, you need to configure the `usage_reporting` section in your Hive Router configuration file.

[Learn more about usage reporting in the documentation.](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/configuration/usage_reporting)
```yaml
usage_reporting:
  enabled: true
  access_token: your-hive-console-access-token
```

## 0.0.21 (2025-11-28)

### Features

- Subgraph Timeout Configuration (#541)

#### Subgraph Request Timeout Feature

Adds support for configurable subgraph request timeouts via the `traffic_shaping` configuration. The `request_timeout` option allows you to specify the maximum time the router will wait for a response from a subgraph before timing out the request. You can set a static timeout (e.g., `30s`) globally or per-subgraph, or use dynamic timeouts with VRL expressions to vary timeout values based on request characteristics. This helps protect your router from hanging requests and enables fine-grained control over how long requests to different subgraphs should be allowed to run.

#### Rename `original_url` variable to `default` in subgraph URL override expressions.

This change aligns the variable naming with other configuration expressions, such as timeout configuration.

When using expressions to override subgraph URLs, use `.default` to refer to the original URL defined in the subgraph definition.

Example:

```yaml
url:
  expression: |
    if .request.headers."x-region" == "us-east" {
      "https://products-us-east.example.com/graphql"
    } else {
      .default
    }
```

### Fixes

- support `@include` and `@skip` in initial fetch node (#591)
- Fixed an issue where `@skip` and `@include` directives were incorrectly removed from the initial Fetch of the Query Plan.

## 0.0.20 (2025-11-24)

### Features

- support authenticated and requiresScopes directives (#538)

#### Directive-Based Authorization

Introducing directive-based authorization. This allows you to enforce fine-grained access control directly from your subgraph schemas using the `@authenticated` and `@requiresScopes` directives.

This new authorization layer runs before the query planner, ensuring that unauthorized requests are handled efficiently without reaching your subgraphs.

#### Configuration

You can configure how the router handles unauthorized requests with two modes:

- **`filter`** (default): Silently removes any fields the user is not authorized to see from the query. The response will contain `null` for the removed fields and an error in the `errors` array.
- **`reject`**: Rejects the entire GraphQL operation if it requests any field the user is not authorized to access.

To configure this, add the following to your `router.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
authentication:
  directives:
    unauthorized:
      # "filter" (default): Removes unauthorized fields from the query and returns errors.
      # "reject": Rejects the entire request if any unauthorized field is requested.
      mode: reject
```

If this section is omitted, the router will use `filter` mode by default.

#### JWT Scope Requirements

When using the `@requiresScopes` directive, the router expects the user's granted scopes to be present in the JWT payload. The scopes should be in an array of strings or a string (scopes separated by space), within a claim named `scope`.

Here is an example of a JWT payload with the correct format:

```json
{
  "sub": "user-123",
  "scope": [
    "read:products",
    "write:reviews"
  ],
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

#### Breaking

Removed `pool_idle_timeout_seconds` from `traffic_shaping`, instead use `pool_idle_timeout` with duration format.

```diff
traffic_shaping:
-  pool_idle_timeout_seconds: 30
+  pool_idle_timeout: 30s
```

##540 by @ardatan

### Fixes

#### Avoid extra `query` prefix for anonymous queries

When there is no variable definitions and no operation name, GraphQL queries can be sent without the `query` prefix. For example, instead of sending:

```diff
- query {
+ {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}
```

## 0.0.19 (2025-11-19)

### Features

#### Use `hive-console-sdk` to load supergraph from Hive CDN

**Breaking Changes**

The configuration for the `hive` source has been updated to offer more specific timeout controls and support for self-signed certificates. The `timeout` field has been renamed.

```diff
supergraph:
  source: hive
  endpoint: "https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/supergraph"
  key: "YOUR_CDN_KEY"
- timeout: 30s
+ request_timeout: 30s          # `request_timeout` replaces `timeout`
+ connect_timeout: 10s          # new option to control `connect` phase
+ accept_invalid_certs: false   # new option to allow accepting invalid TLS certificates
```

## 0.0.18 (2025-11-18)

### Features

#### JWT claims caching for improved performance

**Performance improvement:** JWT token claims are now cached for up to 5 seconds, reducing the overhead of repeated decoding and verification operations. This optimization increases throughput by approximately 75% in typical workloads.

**What's changed:**
- Decoded JWT payloads are cached with a 5-second time-to-live (TTL), which respects token expiration times
- The cache automatically invalidates based on the token's `exp` claim, ensuring security is maintained

**How it affects you:**
If you're running Hive Router, you'll see significant performance improvements out of the box with no configuration needed. The 5-second cache provides an optimal balance between performance gains and cache freshness without requiring manual tuning.

## 0.0.17 (2025-11-04)

### Fixes

- Trigger release pipeline to fix issues with 0.0.16 release

## 0.0.16 (2025-11-04)

### Fixes

- Internal refactor that prevents the need to create some structs (`ClientRequestDetails`) twice. This change also eliminates the need to have clones

#### Improve the implementation of jwt plugin and expose it to expressions.

The following properties are available in the request object exposed to VRL expressions:
- `request.jwt` will always be an object
- `request.jwt.authenticated` with value of true or false
- `request.jwt.prefix` can either be a string or null (if prefix is not used)
- `request.jwt.token` can be string (when authenticated=true) or null (when authenticated=false)
- `request.jwt.claims` will always be an array (either empty or with values), containing the full JWT token claims payload.
- `request.jwt.scopes` will always be an array (either empty or with values), containing the scopes extracted from the claims

Here are examples on how to use the JWT properties in a VRL expression:

```yaml
## Passes the user-id held in `.sub` claims of the token to the subgraph, or EMPTY
headers:
  all:
    request:
      - insert:
          name: X-User-ID
          expression: |
            if .request.jwt.authenticated == true {
              .request.jwt.claims.sub
            } else {
              "EMPTY"
            }
```

```yaml
## Passes a custom header based on the status of the authentication and the status of the JWT scopes
headers:
 subgraphs:
    accounts:
      request:
        - insert:
            name: X-Can-Read
            expression: |
              if .request.jwt.authenticated == true && includes!(.request.jwt.scopes, "read:accounts") {
                "Yes"
              } else {
                "No"
              }
```
